Flow/Error Handling ls:

	- arguments, error check that you're passed in 3 arguments total
	
	- take argument from command line and check if it's valid:
		- check if first index is a '/'
		- strip the last '/' if it exists, and check if file exists at that path


	- map disk image, and ensure no errors from this

	- get super block, and get group descriptor
	- find inode table from group descriptor

	- use recursive function to find the inode specifically for that file name, using recursive helper function
		- if node does not exist, return an error
		- node will always be a directory, not a file, so dont worry about this case

	- use print helper function to actually print what's at this inode, including the .. ., similar to ex10, but we only want the names, nothing more
